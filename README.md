This repository hosts the code for the Cafe Digital System (CDS), a comprehensive C++ project that encompasses various features including file handling,
pointers, arrays, dynamic memory allocation (DMA), and coloring. CDS is designed to simulate a digital system for managing a cafe, providing functionalities
such as order processing, inventory management, and customer interaction.
